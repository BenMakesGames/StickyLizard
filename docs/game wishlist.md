we want to create a lizard management game with two main gameplay modes for now:

* training:
  * the player will own multiple lizards
  * choose what the lizards will do for a week
  * possible lizard activities:
    * train stickiness
    * (more activities, including rest, will be added later)
  * press a button to advance to the next week
* weight-dragging competition:
  * a lizard with sticky feet is used to pull weights along the ground
  * the player enters a competition of some difficulty
  * difficulty + the lizard's stickiness determines chances of success
  * competition does not take time, but each lizard can only participate in one competition per week
  * competition trains stats

other considerations:

* cross-platform desktop game (Windows, Mac, & Linux)
* single-player
* distributed via itch.io
* ability to save & load the game
* Claude Code as primary developer - pick a language/framework that plays well with AI/LLMs
