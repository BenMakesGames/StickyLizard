## How to Play

1. **Get a lizard** and give it a name
2. **Train** your lizard each week to increase its stickiness
3. **Enter competitions** — your lizard clings to increasing weights round by round
4. **Score points** based on how many rounds your lizard survives, multiplied by difficulty
5. Repeat — train harder, compete at higher difficulties
